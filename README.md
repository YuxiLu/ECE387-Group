# ECE387-Group_Project
## Introduction
* This is our group final project. We plan to do an indoor environment monitoring kit. 
## Functionality 
* Not only basic values such as temperature and humidity can be detected, but also the presence of air pressure, air pollution index, smoke, flammable gases and light. The alarm also will be made to notice the people of toxic gas. And we will use an LCD to print the data. Maybe we will use more modules like buttons, RGB LEDs and buzzers.
